# What is it?

I am glad that my project has attracted your attention. This is a random quote generator, you can tweet these quotes or add them to your tumblr.

So that the process of searching for interesting quotes is not boring, the color of the application changes every time you press the "New quote" button.

# What API did I use?

To generate new quotes, I used this API: https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable , the request function is asynchronous.

I propose to test my application: https://titanic00.github.io/random-quotes-app/ . This is my first written application where I used all my acquired knowledge of react and redux.
